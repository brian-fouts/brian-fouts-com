                    I believe in creating games that are tailored to the needs and preferences of players, and I use data-driven design to achieve this. To 
                    create realistic game environments and characters, I use 3D modeling software such as Blender. I am skilled in AI, which can be used 
                    to create intelligent game characters and enhance the overall gaming experience. I also have experience in optimizing games for 
                    multi-core and GPU platforms to ensure that they provide the best possible gaming experience.

                    I am proficient in using Unity, which is a powerful game engine that enables me to develop games for a variety of platforms such as 
                    mobile, desktop, and web. I also have experience in interpolation, animation, frame budgeting, path planning, data-driven design, 3D modeling, 
                    sockets, and matchmaking. I am also familiar with THREE.js, which is a JavaScript library that can be used to create 3D graphics in the
                    browser.
